Here we will explain about how favorite games and least favorite games and why.

## **Favorite games**
-**Borderlands Franchise:**
We enjoy the story it tells plus the villan and like  loot-shooter type games.

-**Call of Duty Black Ops Series:**
We enjoy the campaigns especially  the BO1 and BO2 plus the other game modes like zombies for the easters eggs to do or just to get to high rounds.

-**Rainbow Six Siege:**
We enjoy this game for the more tactical shooter rather then run and gun shooter like COD series plus to just grind the ranks to get cool charms and rewards

## **Least Favorite Games**
-**Battlefield 5:**
We didnt enjoy this game because it was dissapointing and didnt deliver on the amount of content it was supposed to have

-**Anthem:**
We didnt enjoy this game since it was ovverhyped and didn't deliver since it was super glitchy and unfun
